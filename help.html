    <div id="overview">
This page gives advice on using the databrowser and interpreting results.
    </div>

    <h2>Selecting Countries / Groups</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
The British Petroleum 2008 Statistical Review breaks out consumption and production data
by country, continent and a few groupings like 'Former Soviet Union' and 'OPEC'.  In the case
of countries of the Former Soviet Union, all data prior to 1985 is lumped
together as 'Former Soviet Union'. This means that individual countries like 'Ukraine' or 
'Russian Federation' have no production/consumption data prior to 1985.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Interesting Groups</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
The code behind the Energy Export Databrowser makes it possible to calculate consumption/production statistics
for any combination of countries.  An initial application of this capability is found in the 
'Interesting Groups' section of the 'Country / Group' selector.  Choosing one of these
mult-country groups will show the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Countries in the map are colored by whether they imported or exported in 2007.</li>
        <li>The production/consumption graph represents the sum of all countries in the group.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
The 'Interesting Groups' section includes the following abbreviations:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>FSU</dt>
        <dd>Former Soviet Union</dd>
        <dt>OPEC</dt>
        <dd>Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</dd>
        <dt>OECD</dt>
        <dd>Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</dd>
        <dt>G7</dt>
        <dd>US, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada</dd>
        <dt>O5</dt>
        <dd>Brazil, China, Indonesia, India, South Africa</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>

    <h2>Interpreting Graphics</h2>
    <div>
Various interesting patterns appear in the data graphics.  A few interpretations are provided here.
    </div>

    <h3>Peak Production</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
Uninterrupted by war or political upheaval and developed with the latest technology, the North Sea provides a very
good example of a 'normal' (almost gaussian) production curve that is now past 'peak' production.
It is anticipated that annual production volumes will continue to decline barring a dramatic new
discovery.

    </div>

    <h3>Export Land Model</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
The 'Export Land Model' proposed by Jeffrey Brown and Samuel Foucher describes how developing
nations, enriched by oil profits, will grow economically and increase their own consumption
of energy resources.  Declining production and increasing consumption can rapidly turn an
exporting nation into one that requires imports as exemplified by Indonesia.
      </p>

    </div>

    <h3>War</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
One of the reasons nations go to war is to gain access to resources.  However, in the case of
energy resources, the damage to infrastructure inflicted by modern warfare can reduce rather than
increase access to those resources.  Nowhere is this more true than in Iraq.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Iran-Iraq War (1981-1988)</li>
        <li>First Gulf War (1990-1991)</li>
        <li>Sanctions (1991-2003)</li>
        <li>Iraq War (2003-????)</li>
      </ul>
      <img alt="Iraq Oil Production" src="images/BP_2008_Oil_EG____IQ___0.png" />
    </div>

    <h3>Domestic Consumption Only</h3>
    <div>
In some countries in some years, production and consumption match.  In these cases, the country
will be colored gray in the map.  This is often seen when looking at Natural Gas which is 
largely dependent upon pipelines for export.  Until recently, Colombia had no means for exporting
its Natural Gas and all production was consumed domestically.
